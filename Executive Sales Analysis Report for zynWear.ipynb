    "3. **Seasonal Promotions:** Focus marketing efforts and promotions on Fall and Spring, as these are the highest sales seasons. Consider targeted discounts and special offers during these periods.\n",
    "4. **Enhance Male-Focused Marketing:** Since males spend more and have more previous purchases, tailor marketing campaigns to male customers, highlighting popular items like pants.\n",
    "5. **Leverage Popular Items:** Promote top-selling items like blouses and seasonal favorites (e.g., hats in Fall, sweaters in Spring) through targeted advertising and special promotions.\n",
    "6. **Increase Subscription Offerings:** Explore ways to boost subscriptions in lower-performing categories like Outerwear, perhaps through bundled offers or exclusive subscriber discounts.\n",
    "7. **Improve Discount Strategies:** Given the high number of discounts in Spring, consider balancing discount strategies across all seasons to maintain consistent sales performance.\n",
    "8. **Streamline Payment and Shipping Options:** Continue to offer and possibly expand free shipping and PayPal options, as these are preferred by customers.\n",
